## Tips:

Here's an example simple application w/ React, Redux, and Redux Sagas as middleware: https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-media-library-with-react-redux-and-redux-saga-part-1#toc-project-setup

May want to consider adding this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist if we plan to maintain courses in the frontend. 

Useful devtools (from chrome):
